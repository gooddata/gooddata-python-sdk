# Flight RPC Setup
#######################################################################

# host to bind Flight RPC server to. Default is 127.0.0.1 - listening on
# localhost only.
#
# use:
#
# - 0.0.0.0 - to bind to all addressed = reachable via network
# - 127.0.0.1 - to bind to localhost only (unreachable via outside network)
# - custom address to bind to
#
listen_host = "127.0.0.1"

# port on which the Flight RPC server should listen
listen_port = 17001

# host name to use when sending this server's Flight RPC location to clients.
# Defaults to current hostname.
#
# Advertising different host from the one that the server is bound to is
# often needed in Dockerized environments.
#
# ---
#
# Example: you run the server inside Docker on localhost and have port forwarding
# setup. You want to access the server from your workstation. In this setup,
# the 'listen_host' is set to "0.0.0.0" (server listens on all interfaces within
# the container) and the 'advertise_host' is set to "localhost".
#
# When you make a GetFlightInfo call to the server (running inside docker), it will
# generate a Flight accordingly and the returned Locations will again point at
# "localhost" so the subsequent DoGet call goes again to the Dockerized server.
#
# Without the 'advertise_host', the GetFlightInfo would return Location referencing
# some internal / randomly assigned hostname that is unreachable from your workstation.
advertise_host = "127.0.0.1"

# port number to use when sending this server's Flight RPC location to clients.
# Defaults to value of 'listen_port'.
#
# Advertising different port from the one that the server is listening is often
# needed in environments where port forwarding is in effect.
#
# ---
#
# Example: you run multiple servers inside Docker on localhost and have port
# forwarding setup. Each server goes to different port.
#
# Analogous to the host example (see above), the Dockerized server needs to send
# location with port number that can be reached from your workstation.
advertise_port = 17001

# TLS Setup
#######################################################################

# optionally specify to use TLS; default when not specified is False
#
# IMPORTANT: when you turn on TLS, you must also specify at minimum
# the TLS certificate and TLS private key for the server to use.
# Additionally, if you use self-signed certificates, you need to
# also specify the tls_root_certificate.
use_tls = true

# TODO: WIP this may move to authentication section?
use_mtls = true

# if you want to use TLS (see 'use_tls' above), then you must specify
# server's certificate.
#
# This is supposed to be a PEM encoded X.509 certificate identifying
# your server.
#
# You can inline the certificate value into this setting, or you can
# specify file where the certificate resides.
#
# To specify certificate file, code the value of this setting as
# '@/absolute/path/to/cert`
tls_certificate = "..."

# if you want to use TLS (see 'use_tls' above), then you must specify
# the server's private key.
#
# This is supposed to be PEM encoded X.509 private key. Similar to
# the certificate, you can also use the '@/absolute/path/to/cert'
# notation to make server load the certificate from some file.
#
# IMPORTANT: never commit config files containing inlined secrets
# such as the private key into VCS. You can leverage the server's
# ability to combine config from multiple files: have one file
# without secrets and commit that to VCS if you so desire. The other
# config file with secrets should be outside of VCS.
tls_private_key = "..."

# if you use mTLS and have self-signed certificates, then you must
# also include the X.509 certificate of your CA that signed them.
#
# Again, you can inline the certificate in PEM encoding right here
# into this setting, or you can use the '@/absolute/path/to/ca-cert'
# notation.

# specify authentication method to use. can be one of 'none' or 'token'.
#
# if you do not include this option, then the server will not do
# any authentication. This is dangerous if your server is listening
# on interfaces that are reachable from the public network.
#
# if you specify the 'token' method, then the default strategy
# for verifying tokens is the 'EnumeratedTokenVerification'. For this
# to work, you need to specify one or more valid tokens that the
# client is expected to send. See the end of this file on how to
# do this.
#
# Alternatively, you can implement your own strategy for verifying
# tokens. See the option below.
authentication_method = "none"

# Specify strategy to use for verifying tokens.
#
# The default strategy is 'EnumeratedTokenVerification' which expects
# that client sends a token that is included in a list of allowed
# tokens. See the end of this file for example how to define those
# tokens.
#
# To implement your own token verification strategy, you need to
# implement your own subclass of 'TokenVerificationStrategy' and
# then modify this setting to provide module name that contains
# that implementation.
#
# For example if the full path to class implementing your strategy
# is my_server.auth.custom.MyCustomStrategy, then the value
# of the 'token_verification' should be 'my_server.auth.custom'.
#
# Upon startup, the server will try to dynamically import and
# load your implementation of TokenVerificationStrategy from the
# specified module.
token_verification = "EnumeratedTokenVerification"

# Optionally specify header name that is expected to carry the
# token.
#
# If not specified, the token is expected to come in a HTTP-like
# convention: the 'authorization' header (must be lower-case) and
# the value of 'Bearer <token>' where <token> is the value token
# itself.
