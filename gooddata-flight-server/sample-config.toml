# host to bind Flight RPC server to. Default is 127.0.0.1 - listening on
# localhost only.
#
# use:
#
# - 0.0.0.0 - to bind to all addressed = reachable via network
# - 127.0.0.1 - to bind to localhost only (unreachable via outside network)
# - custom address to bind to
#
listen_host = "127.0.0.1"

# port on which the Flight RPC server should listen
listen_port = 17001

# host name to use when sending this server's Flight RPC location to clients.
# Defaults to current hostname.
#
# Advertising different host from the one that the server is bound to is
# often needed in Dockerized environments.
#
# ---
#
# Example: you run the server inside Docker on localhost and have port forwarding
# setup. You want to access the server from your workstation. In this setup,
# the 'listen_host' is set to "0.0.0.0" (server listens on all interfaces within
# the container) and the 'advertise_host' is set to "localhost".
#
# When you make a GetFlightInfo call to the server (running inside docker), it will
# generate a Flight accordingly and the returned Locations will again point at
# "localhost" so the subsequent DoGet call goes again to the Dockerized server.
#
# Without the 'advertise_host', the GetFlightInfo would return Location referencing
# some internal / randomly assigned hostname that is unreachable from your workstation.
advertise_host = "127.0.0.1"

# port number to use when sending this server's Flight RPC location to clients.
# Defaults to value of 'listen_port'.
#
# Advertising different port from the one that the server is listening is often
# needed in environments where port forwarding is in effect.
#
# ---
#
# Example: you run multiple servers inside Docker on localhost and have port
# forwarding setup. Each server goes to different port.
#
# Analogous to the host example (see above), the Dockerized server needs to send
# location with port number that can be reached from your workstation.

# Task Handling
#######################################################################

# flight listing. Default is 32.
#
# Each GetFlightInfo request that generates a flight delegates this
# to a task. The task executes in a thread pool of this size.
