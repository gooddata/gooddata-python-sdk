# Cursor IDE Workflow Validation

## Workflow Constraints

- Include all rules related to the user question; if rules mention dependencies, include those too.
- After fully answering, report the list of used rules.
- Example: **Used rules**: general/general, technologies/python, packages/gooddata-sdk
- Do not print rule previews or long plans.
- Keep status updates to one short sentence.
- Never inline full rule contents; reference by rule path only when needed.

## Rule Search

Always look for relevant cursor rules based on the character of changes.
