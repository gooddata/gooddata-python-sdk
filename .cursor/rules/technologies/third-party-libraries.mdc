# Third-Party Library Integration

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Preventing Outdated Knowledge Issues

**LLMs may have outdated training data. Always verify current information before suggesting third-party libraries.**

## Library Integration Hierarchy

### ✅ PREFERRED: Internal GoodData Packages
**ALWAYS use these instead of external alternatives:**
- `gooddata-sdk` - Core SDK functionality
- `gooddata-pandas` - Pandas integration
- `gooddata-api-client` - Generated API client

### 🟡 APPROVED: Stable External Libraries
**Pre-approved (but verify versions in pyproject.toml):**
- pandas, numpy - Data processing
- attrs, cattrs - Data classes and serialization
- requests, httpx - HTTP clients
- pytest, vcrpy - Testing

### 🔴 REQUIRES WEB SEARCH: Unknown/New Libraries
**MANDATORY verification before suggesting:**
- Any library not in approved lists above
- Libraries from rapidly changing ecosystems (AI/ML, async frameworks)
- Beta/alpha versions of any library
- Libraries with major version changes in last 6 months

## When to ALWAYS Search the Web

**MANDATORY TRIGGERS:**
1. New library integration (not in our approved stack)
2. Version-specific APIs (libraries known to change frequently)
3. Migration scenarios (upgrading between major versions)
4. Deprecated warnings
5. Fast-evolving ecosystems (Python AI/ML, async, type systems)
6. Cloud provider SDKs (AWS, GCP, Azure)

**Search Strategy:**
- Search: "library-name current version documentation"
- Look for: "library-name migration guide" or "breaking changes"
- Check: Official GitHub repository for recent releases
- Verify: API examples from official docs (not generic tutorials)
