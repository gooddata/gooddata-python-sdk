# GoodData Python SDK Coding Guidelines

Applies to all packages and code in this Python SDK workspace.
Think in steps before changes. Search for relevant cursor rules based on the character of changes.

## Core Principles

**Search first, don't invent**: Always search this repository for everything related to the developer question. **Do not invent a new design for something that already exists!**

**Code Principles**: **1** Simplicity, **2** Readability, **3** Performance (don't over-optimize), **4** Maintainability, **5** Testability, **6** Reusability, **7** Encapsulation & single responsibility

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: AI Behavior Rules - ALWAYS ENFORCE

**NO AUTO-IMPLEMENTATION**: 
- Do not generate code changes unless user explicitly asks for it
- NEVER create summary/documentation markdown files unless explicitly requested
- Break complex tasks into smaller deliverable units

**For complex tasks**:
1. Implement ONLY the first task, then STOP
2. Ask permission to continue, offering: (a) next task only, or (b) all remaining tasks
3. Create todos but DO NOT auto-implement them
4. When in doubt, ask before implementing

## Code Validation

**If gdc-ruler MCP server is available**: Use `validate_python` tool with this workspace path.
```
validate_python(path=".")  # From workspace root
```

**Otherwise**: Run manually:
```bash
make format-fix && make mypy && make test
```

**Scoped testing**: `TEST_ENVS=py312 ADD_ARGS="-k test_name" make test`

See `technologies/testing` rule for VCR cassette workflow.

## Package Structure

**Workspace packages** (in `packages/`):
- `gooddata-sdk` - Core SDK for GoodData Cloud
- `gooddata-pandas` - Pandas integration layer
- `gooddata-dbt`, `gooddata-flight-server`, `gooddata-flexconnect`, `gooddata-pipelines`
- `tests-support` - Shared test utilities

**Generated clients** (do NOT edit manually):
- `gooddata-api-client` - Generated from OpenAPI specs

## Dependencies

**Internal**: Use `~={current_version}` for package dependencies.

**Adding**: Add to `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock`.

## OpenAPI Client Generation

**DO NOT manually edit** generated client code in `gooddata-*-client/` directories.

See `.openapi-generator/README.md` for regeneration instructions.

## Fast-Changing Dependencies

**When suggesting third-party libraries**: Verify current APIs, prefer established libraries, check Python 3.10+ compatibility.
