* Catalog Workspaces Service
* Catalog Workspace Content Service
* Catalog Data Source Service
* Catalog User Service
* Catalog Permission Service
* Catalog Organization Service
* Insights Service
* Compute Service
* Table Service

See [DOCUMENTATION](https://www.gooddata.com/docs/python-sdk/1.11.0) for more details.

## Requirements

-  GoodData Cloud or GoodData.CN installation
-  Python 3.8 or newer

## Installation

Run the following command to install the `gooddata-sdk` package on your system:

    pip install gooddata-sdk

## Example

Compute an insight:
```python
import gooddata_sdk

# GoodData host in the form of uri
host = "http://localhost:3000"
# GoodData user token
token = "some_user_token"
sdk = gooddata_sdk.GoodDataSdk.create(host, token)

workspace_id = "demo"
insight_id = "customers_trend"
# reads insight from workspace
insight = sdk.insights.get_insight(workspace_id, insight_id)
# triggers computation for the insight. the result will be returned in a tabular form
table = sdk.tables.for_insight(workspace_id, insight)

# and this is how you can read data row-by-row and do something with it
for row in table.read_all():
    print(row)
```
