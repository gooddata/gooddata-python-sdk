The Backup & Restore module lets you create snapshots of GoodData Cloud workspaces and restore them later. It is useful for:

- Backing up before major changes
- Migrating workspaces across environments
- Disaster recovery
- Cloning workspace configurations

Backup and restore share common configuration objects, documented on the [Configuration](configuration/) page. For detailed, step-by-step instructions, see the [Backup](backup/) and [Restore](restore/) guides.
