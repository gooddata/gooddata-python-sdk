If you are getting the following message:

__(Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE\_VERIFY\_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (\_ssl.c:1129)')))__

it is likely caused by Python, and it occurs if you have installed Python directly from python.org.

To mitigate, please install your SSL certificates in __HD -> Applications -> Python -> Install Certificates.command__.

To make use of the package, you need a running instance of GoodData. If you do not have GoodData yet, sign up for a [trial of GoodData Cloud](https://www.gooddata.com/trial/).

### Versioning

The Python SDK is versioned and usually released in tandem with GoodData Cloud.

#### GoodData Cloud

When working with GoodData Cloud, we recommend you always work with the newest Python SDK available.

### Troubleshooting

In case of any issues with Python SDK, feel free to reach out to us on our [community slack](https://www.gooddata.com/slack/) or create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata-python-sdk/issues).
