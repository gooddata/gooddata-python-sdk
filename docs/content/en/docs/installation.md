If you are getting the following message:

__(Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE\_VERIFY\_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (\_ssl.c:1129)')))__

it is likely caused by Python and it occurs if you have installed Python directly from python.org.

To mitigate, please istall your SSL certificates in __HD -> Applications -> Python -> Install Certificates.command__.

To make use of the package, you need a running instance of GoodData. If you do not have GoodData yet, sign up for a [trial of GoodData Cloud](https://www.gooddata.com/trial/).

### Versioning

The Python SDK is versioned. The version you should be using depends on the type of GoodData distribution you are using.

We recommend you always work with the newest (supported) Python available.
