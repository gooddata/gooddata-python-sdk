# Tests Support Package

**Location**: `packages/tests-support/`

## Owns

- Shared test utilities reused across multiple repository packages
- VCR helpers for cassette normalization and deterministic request/response handling
- File and deep-comparison helper functions used by package test suites

## Does NOT Own

- Product/runtime code for any customer-facing package
- Package-specific test scenarios (those remain with each package under `packages/*/tests`)
- Core SDK API behavior and domain services → `gooddata-sdk`

## Architecture

**Primary package**: `src/tests_support`

**Main modules**: `vcrpy_utils.py`, `compare_utils.py`, `file_utils.py`

**Role**: test-only utility package consumed from dependency groups in other packages

## Testing

Prefer adding shared test helpers here only when at least two packages need the behavior.

## Dependencies

Required: technologies/python
Related: technologies/testing, packages/gooddata-sdk, packages/gooddata-pandas
